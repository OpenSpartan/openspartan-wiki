This project is a labor of love - I am a big fan of Halo, as you can tell from [my own blog](https://den.dev/blog/), and the more I started exploring the Halo API and diving into the depths of everything it has to offer (even building [a wrapper for it](https://github.com/dend/grunt)), I realized that the best way for me to actually capture all the knowledge is by starting a public documentation site.

Everything here came from pure exploration of the API and taking in the little breadcrumbs along the way that enabled the exploration. It goes without saying that everything you read here is _unofficial_ - that is, neither 343 Industries nor Microsoft support and/or endorse this project. It's just something maintained in my free time.
